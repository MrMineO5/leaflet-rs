# Leaflet-rs
A custom Minecraft server/protocol library written in Rust.

This project is a way for me to explore various Rust concepts and features, so there is no guarantee the project will ever be finished or even reach a usable state.
If you find this library useful (somehow), it is recommended to specify a commit hash.
