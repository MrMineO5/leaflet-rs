# Leaflet-rs
A custom Minecraft server/protocol library written in Rust.

This project is a way for me to explore various Rust concepts and features, so there is no guarantee the project will ever be finished or even reach a usable state.
If you find this library useful (somehow), it is recommended to specify a commit hash. e.g.
```toml
[dependencies]
leaflet_protocol = { git = "https://github.com/MrMineO5/leaflet-rs.git", rev = "74e48ae4cb42fcb714d202b75c946504c41e8604" }
```
